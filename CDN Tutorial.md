# What is CDN 
`CDN stands for Content Dlivery Network. A CDN is a system of distrubuted  servers that hosts resources such as images, CSS, JavaScript files etc`
`Companies like [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Google](https://www.google.com), [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com) etc have a free public CDN from which we can load jQuery instead of hosting it on our own web server`.
