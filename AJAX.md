# What is AJAX ?
`AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.`

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.</p></li>
<li><p>Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the sever using synchronous requests. It means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server.</p></li>
<li><p>With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used.</p></li>
<li><p>AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.</p></li>
<li><p>A user can continue to use the application while the client program requests information from the server in the background.</p></li>
<li><p>Intuitive and natural user interaction. Clicking is not required, mouse movement is a sufficient event trigger.</p></li>
<li><p>Data-driven as opposed to page-driven.</p></li>
</ul>
